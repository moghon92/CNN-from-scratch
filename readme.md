This is a vectorized mplementation of CNN from scratch

- convolution.py : An implementation of the convolutional layer. We convolve the input with out_channels different filters and each filter spans all channels in the input.
- Linear.py : A linear layer with weight W and bias b. Output is computed by y = Wx + b
- Maxpool.py : vectorized implementation of the max pool layer of input
- RelU.py : relu from scratch
- Softmax_ce.py: softmax cross entropy from scratch
